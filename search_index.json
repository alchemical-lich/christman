Allow black powder weapons from Carcass Crawler. 2.2 Setting Notes Pseudo-European, set in the 16th century. Human-centric but all advanced OSE races exist throughout Europe, with varying frequency, e.g., Elvish populations are slightly larger in Ireland, France, and Wallachia, dwarves in Switzerland, the Habsburg Empire, and Scandinavia. Gnomes in Scandinavia and the Ottoman Empire. Halflings are more common in Swabia, Bohemia, and Italy. Half-Orcs in Prussia, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Russia. While flavors of Christianity are dominant, a diversity of religious communities has survived alongside Catholicism since Antiquity. The Protestant Reformation is weakening the power of the Catholic Church and has led to an additional flourishing of religious splinter faiths (Christian or not). While the existence of god(s) is unproven, divine magic is real. There are scholarly disagreements about the source of divine magic and planar beings. 2.3 Treasure Total treasure value in the module: about 2 OSE levels from 4 to 6 (roughly 25k in OSE), with assuming five PCs, implies a total of 120k treasure XP. 2.4 Short Summary of the Main Conflict Christman Grippertenius is a dangerous brigand who has been terrorizing the region. The cloth and wine merchants of Metz have made a secret arrangement with him. They finance a steady supply of wine, ale, food, and weapons, as well as substantial coin, and protect him from official prosecution. In turn, Christman organizes his banditry to focus on other local merchants and regions further away from Metz, targeting rivaling merchant houses. As long as Christman receives his supply, he will mostly remain in his lair and drink. At times, he will leave to meet with his bandit groups to organize a raid or participate himself. If his supply, especially alcohol, runs out, he will become restless and eventually attack travelers and the town of Metz. Think of him as a ticking time bomb for the adventure. Sooner or later, unless the PCs begin to meddle, someone will drive Christman out of his lair, with dire consequences for the whole region. The new Bürgermeister of Metz, Simon Hofstatter is unaware of the secret arrangement between Christman and the cloth and wine merchants. He has promised to root out banditry in the Bergkessel region, especially the famous Christman after a public uproar over the disappearance of Lise Mueller. He has issued rewards for the capture of Christman and other bandits. Surely, this will attract adventures that will upend the delicate state of affairs in the Bergkessel region. Lise Mueller, the young daughter of a Metzian goldsmith, is a satanic witch. The devil appeared in her dreams and tasked her with bearing Christman’s child. She is convinced that a child conceived under Satan’s gaze and of the bandit’s loins will become a powerful harbinger of doom. She has let herself be captured by Christman and is currently “held captive” in his lair. Christman has no desire for offspring (nor sex for that matter) and has been largely ignoring her. Lise is plotting a way to seduce or incapacitate Christman to harvest his seed. Peter Niers, a serial killer, necromancer, and former apprentice to Christman, is planning to usurp Christman’s unofficial position as leader of the various bandit groups in the Bergkessel. He loathes the old bandit and is determined to rule the region. He also wants the book The Rites of the Pale Wedding from Christman’s hoard to ascent to lichdom and create an undead wife for himself. He has engaged the Greencloak Pikes to help him in his endeavor and has secretly tasked them to mess with the wine and cloth merchants, hoping to drive a wedge between them and Christman. The Witch Hunter Wilhelm von Hagen is roaming the region, hunting heretics, witches, and other non-believers. He is pursuing rumors about a witches coven in the region and wolf attacks around Bedburg.He will involve himself in the affairs of the Bergkessel region if he feels it gives him an opportunity to burn someone at the stake. There are a few other, minor actors in the region with their own agendas. Legend says Christman’s treasure cache has grown to the size of 100k gold pieces. Rumors of this hoard might just make anyone dare to find his lair… 2.5 Dramatis Personae 2.5.1 Christman Grippertenius Also called Papedöne, the Bergkessel Butcher, and Schwarzer Friedrich. 63 years old, tall as a tree, a drunk, eyes reveal a deep emptiness, stinks of sweat, piss, liquor, and vomit. Pocked, gin nose, hands as big as frying pans. Old, wiry muscles, tough like old leather, cunning. Just a man. Spends most days in a drunken stupor. Likes to strangle people to death. He is also a poison expert. Due to years of exposure (and the amount of alcohol in his system), he is immune to poisons himself. Despite the rumors, Christman is no demon, undead or otherwise magical creature. He has made no pact with the devil. He is just a man with base urges. The worst humanity has to offer. Christman Grippertenius–Level-10 Fighter-Thief (OSE): AC 16, HD 10 (65), Attacks: 2x weapon (sword 1d8+5, throwing knife 1d4+3), THAC0: 12[+7/+9 with longsword], Movement: 120’ (40’), ST: D6 W7 P8 B8 S10, Morale 11, Alignment CE, XP 500. Special: Sword and dagger are poisoned. If target loses 1 or more HP, save vs Poison or take an additional 1d4 damage per round for 1d4 rounds and be paralyzed for the same duration. Christman is immune to poison, Backstab, Thief Skills: CS 96, TR 80, H-N 1-4, HS 75, MS 85, OL 85, PP 85. Christman is a master skulker. He is never surprised but surprises enemies on a 1-4. Equipment: Old longsword+2 (crusted with dried blood, utterly mundane but poisoned), poisoned throwing daggers, a bottle of ale, leather armor +2, Boots of Elvenkind. Combat strategy: Christman does not fight fair. He will hit-and-run, lure enemies into traps and ambushes, target spellcasters (and make sure the target is dead and not just unconscious), and use his daggers to sideline dangerous warriors. He knows his caves from muscle memory. Fighting Christman, despite him being by himself and a mundane warrior, should be an absolute nightmare. If anyone invades his lair and survives, Christman will pursue them. If his lair is invaded or his alcohol supply dries up, he will rally the local bandit groups to: a) go after any PCs and kill them in their sleep; b) execute a night raid on Metz, attempting to kill the mayor. If that comes to pass, the wine and cloth merchants of Metz will ensure one of their own becomes mayor and stops the hunt for Christman to continue their bargain. Forces beyond this world are watching. Christman has murdered 964 people thus far. If he makes it to 999, God will abandon humankind, and the Gates of Hell will open. He or anyone else is unaware of this issue. This is strictly between God and the world. 2.5.2 Peter Stumpp Peter Stumpp is a wealthy farmer and landowner in Bedburg. He lost his wife years ago and has been raising his four daughters by himself. He is an ambitious man, but loves his daughters. He is currently scheming to marry both of his older daughters off to wealthy suitors, forging business alliances in the process. He controls land suitable for wine growing and wants his family to join with a wine merchant in Metz. Stumpp’s wife died off a sudden fever that also afflicted his daughters. After his wife passed, he sought the help of a local witch (a hag in disguise). She saved the daughters but told Stumpp there will be a price to pay. When the hag came to collect his oldest daughter as payment, Stumpp refused. The hag cursed him to become a werewolf. Afflicted by the werewolf curse, he has killed many innocents in nightly murder sprees. Trying to protect his family, he has begun to lock himself into his barn. The murders have made the Metzian wine merchant skeptical about investing into Stumpp’s land and put the marriage plans for his daughter into jeopardy. Peter Stumpp is a bear of a man with big belly, red hair and moustache, fiercely protective of his daughters. Statistics of a Leader Werewolf. Peter Stumpp Medium, beastly visage.

Niers is a coward and fights as one. He will hide behind his undead or allied bandits. He delights in others pain and might get too close to someone injured to observe their suffering. If injured, he becomes aggravated and lashes out. If severely injured, he will use Invisibility and run. 2.5.4 Bandits Manfred and Hegel Rotbart Two brothers in their thirties.
