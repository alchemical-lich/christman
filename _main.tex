\emph{Dreyerley Neüwezeitung. in Gesangweiß} \href{https://collections.thulb.uni-jena.de/receive/HisBest_cbu_00033564}{Link}
\end{quote}

This adventure is loosely inspired by the crimes of \textbf{Christman Grippertenius} and his associates \textbf{Peter Stumpp} and \textbf{Peter Niers}.

The adventure is meant for a party of 4-6 \textbf{Level 4-8} characters. The adventure is written for \textbf{Advanced OSE} and was playtested with those rules. It should be equally usable with AD\&D/OSRIC, Swords \& Wizardry, LotFP or similar systems.

The player characters will confront a group of murderers that has been terrorizing the region of Bergkessel. The main inspiration for the adventure are the historical stories and murder ballads about Christman Genipperteinga,\footnote{see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christman_Genipperteinga}{Wikipedia} for a quick overview.} Peter Niers,\footnote{see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Niers}{Wikipedia} for a quick overview.} and Peter Stumpp.\footnote{see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stumpp}{Wikipedia} for a quick overview.} The adventure does not strive for historical accuracy, merely to provide an engaging dark fantasy scenario for OSR gaming. If you'd like to read more about each of these three individuals, I recommend \emph{Historische Serienmörder. Menschliche Ungeheuer vom späten Mittelalter bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts}, Kirchschlager, Michael (2014).

\textbf{Content Warning}

The stories that inspired the adventure are particularly grisly and go beyond what most tables would find acceptable for a gaming session. Use your own good judgment and feedback from your players to determine the degree to which you want to include certain elements. This adventure should still offer plenty of opportunity for engaging adventure, even if you make the main antagonists ``regular'' bandits. In this write up, I tried to strike a balance between retaining some of the abhorrent details, while only making veiled references to others. The adventure features themes of violence, implied threats of sexual violence, abduction, child murder, and body horror. Proceed at your own peril.

A big thank you to my players: Hobo, Mr.~White, and John.

This was my first attempt at writing an OSR module. I learned a lot from blogs like Arnold K's Goblin Punch, Prismatic Wasteland, B/X Blackrazor, tenfootpole, Zherblog, Knight at the Opera, Youtube channels like Questing Beast and Bandit's Keep, the \emph{Zock-Bock Radio} podcast, the \emph{Classic Adventure Gaming Podcast}, and the wonderful folks on the ADDKON Server.

\chapter{Adventure Overview}\label{overview}

\section{Notes for using OSE}\label{notes-for-using-ose}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use the regular Advanced OSE system.
\item
  Allow black powder weapons from Carcass Crawler.
\end{itemize}

\section{Setting Notes}\label{setting-notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pseudo-European, set in the 16th century.
\item
  Human-centric but all advanced OSE races exist throughout Europe, with varying frequency, e.g., Elvish populations are slightly larger in Ireland, France, and Wallachia, dwarves in Switzerland, the Habsburg Empire, and Scandinavia. Gnomes in Scandinavia and the Ottoman Empire. Halflings are more common in Swabia, Bohemia, and Italy. Half-Orcs in Prussia, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Russia.
\item
  While flavors of Christianity are dominant, a diversity of religious communities has survived alongside Catholicism since Antiquity. The Protestant Reformation is weakening the power of the Catholic Church and has led to an additional flourishing of religious splinter faiths (Christian or not).
\item
  While the existence of god(s) is unproven, divine magic is real. There are scholarly disagreements about the source of divine magic and planar beings.
\end{itemize}

\section{Treasure}\label{treasure}

Total treasure value in the module: about 2 OSE levels from 4 to 6 (roughly 25k in OSE), with assuming five PCs, implies a total of 120k treasure XP.

\section{Short Summary of the Main Conflict}\label{short-summary-of-the-main-conflict}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Christman Grippertenius} is a dangerous brigand who has been terrorizing the region. The cloth and wine merchants of Metz have made a secret arrangement with him. They finance a steady supply of wine, ale, food, and weapons, as well as substantial coin, and protect him from official prosecution. In turn, Christman organizes his banditry to focus on other local merchants and regions further away from Metz, targeting rivaling merchant houses. As long as Christman receives his supply, he will mostly remain in his lair and drink. At times, he will leave to meet with his bandit groups to organize a raid or participate himself. If his supply, especially alcohol, runs out, he will become restless and eventually attack travelers and the town of Metz. Think of him as a ticking time bomb for the adventure. Sooner or later, unless the PCs begin to meddle, someone will drive Christman out of his lair, with dire consequences for the whole region.
\item
  The new \emph{Bürgermeister of Metz}, \textbf{Simon Hofstatter} is unaware of the secret arrangement between Christman and the cloth and wine merchants. He has promised to root out banditry in the Bergkessel region, especially the famous Christman after a public uproar over the disappearance of \textbf{Lise Mueller}. He has issued rewards for the capture of Christman and other bandits. Surely, this will attract adventures that will upend the delicate state of affairs in the Bergkessel region.
\item
  \textbf{Lise Mueller}, the young daughter of a Metzian goldsmith, is a satanic witch. The devil appeared in her dreams and tasked her with bearing Christman's child. She is convinced that a child conceived under Satan's gaze and of the bandit's loins will become a powerful harbinger of doom. She has let herself be captured by Christman and is currently ``held captive'' in his lair. Christman has no desire for offspring (nor sex for that matter) and has been largely ignoring her. Lise is plotting a way to seduce or incapacitate Christman to harvest his seed.
\item
  \textbf{Peter Niers}, a serial killer, necromancer, and former apprentice to Christman, is planning to usurp Christman's unofficial position as leader of the various bandit groups in the Bergkessel. He loathes the old bandit and is determined to rule the region. He also wants the book \textbf{The Rites of the Pale Wedding} from Christman's hoard to ascent to lichdom and create an undead wife for himself. He has engaged the \textbf{Greencloak Pikes} to help him in his endeavor and has secretly tasked them to mess with the wine and cloth merchants, hoping to drive a wedge between them and Christman.
\item
  \textbf{The Witch Hunter} \textbf{Wilhelm von Hagen} is roaming the region, hunting heretics, witches, and other non-believers. He is pursuing rumors about a witches coven in the region and wolf attacks around Bedburg.He will involve himself in the affairs of the Bergkessel region if he feels it gives him an opportunity to burn someone at the stake.
\item
  There are a few other, minor actors in the region with their own agendas.
\item
  Legend says Christman's treasure cache has grown to the size of 100k gold pieces. Rumors of this hoard might just make anyone dare to find his lair\ldots{}
\end{itemize}

\section{Dramatis Personae}\label{dramatis-personae}

\subsection{Christman Grippertenius}\label{christman-grippertenius}

Also called \emph{Papedöne}, the \emph{Bergkessel Butcher}, and \emph{Schwarzer Friedrich}.

63 years old, tall as a tree, a drunk, eyes reveal a deep emptiness, stinks of sweat, piss, liquor, and vomit. Pocked, gin nose, hands as big as frying pans. Old, wiry muscles, tough like old leather, cunning. Just a man.

Spends most days in a drunken stupor. Likes to strangle people to death. He is also a poison expert. Due to years of exposure (and the amount of alcohol in his system), he is immune to poisons himself.

Despite the rumors, Christman is no demon, undead or otherwise magical creature. He has made no pact with the devil. He is just a man with base urges. The worst humanity has to offer.

\textbf{Christman Grippertenius--Level-10 Fighter-Thief (OSE)}: AC 16, HD 10 (65), \textbf{Attacks}: 2x weapon (sword 1d8+5, throwing knife 1d4+3), \textbf{THAC0}: 12{[}+7/+9 with longsword{]}, Movement: 120' (40'), ST: D6 W7 P8 B8 S10, Morale 11, Alignment CE, XP 500. Special: Sword and dagger are poisoned. If target loses 1 or more HP, save vs Poison or take an additional 1d4 damage per round for 1d4 rounds and be paralyzed for the same duration. Christman is immune to poison, Backstab, Thief Skills: CS 96, TR 80, H-N 1-4, HS 75, MS 85, OL 85, PP 85.

Christman is a master skulker. He is never surprised but surprises enemies on a 1-4.

\emph{Equipment}: Old longsword+2 (crusted with dried blood, utterly mundane but poisoned), poisoned throwing daggers, a bottle of ale, leather armor +2, Boots of Elvenkind.

\emph{Combat strategy}: Christman does not fight fair. He will hit-and-run, lure enemies into traps and ambushes, target spellcasters (and make sure the target is dead and not just unconscious), and use his daggers to sideline dangerous warriors. He knows his caves from muscle memory. Fighting Christman, despite him being by himself and a mundane warrior, should be an absolute nightmare. If anyone invades his lair and survives, Christman will pursue them. If his lair is invaded or his alcohol supply dries up, he will rally the local bandit groups to: a) go after any PCs and kill them in their sleep; b) execute a night raid on Metz, attempting to kill the mayor. If that comes to pass, the wine and cloth merchants of Metz will ensure one of their own becomes mayor and stops the hunt for Christman to continue their bargain.

Forces beyond this world are watching. Christman has murdered 964 people thus far. If he makes it to 999, God will abandon humankind, and the Gates of Hell will open. He or anyone else is unaware of this issue. This is strictly between God and the world.

\subsection{Peter Stumpp}\label{peter-stumpp}

Peter Stumpp is a wealthy farmer and landowner in Bedburg. He lost his wife years ago and has been raising his four daughters by himself. He is an ambitious man, but loves his daughters. He is currently scheming to marry both of his older daughters off to wealthy suitors, forging business alliances in the process. He controls land suitable for wine growing and wants his family to join with a wine merchant in Metz.

Stumpp's wife died off a sudden fever that also afflicted his daughters. After his wife passed, he sought the help of a local witch (a hag in disguise). She saved the daughters but told Stumpp there will be a price to pay. When the hag came to collect his oldest daughter as payment, Stumpp refused. The hag cursed him to become a werewolf.

Afflicted by the werewolf curse, he has killed many innocents in nightly murder sprees. Trying to protect his family, he has begun to lock himself into his barn. The murders have made the Metzian wine merchant skeptical about investing into Stumpp's land and put the marriage plans for his daughter into jeopardy.

Peter Stumpp is a bear of a man with big belly, red hair and moustache, fiercely protective of his daughters. Statistics of a \textbf{Werewolf}.

\subsection{Peter Niers-- Level 7 Necromancer}\label{peter-niers-level-7-necromancer}

Partially raised by Christman, an ambitious necromancer and cannibal. Wants to replace Christman, after having suffered years of abuse under his tutelage. His greatest desire though is to complete the \emph{Rite of the Pale Wedding}, ascending to lichhood and creating an undead wife for himself in the process.

A flop of greasy hair, combed over a bony skull. Only 27 years old, but looks like a corpse.

Niers is a serial murderer. He fuels is necromantic rituals with the life force of fetuses. He has killed 24 pregnant women, mostly abducted in the Bergkessel region. He cuts the fetus from the mother's body, cuts off its hands, and eats its heart.

\textbf{Peter Niers (Necromancer-7)}: AC 12 (16 with \emph{Bone Armor}), HD 7 (25), \textbf{Attacks}: 1x weapon (Lifedrinking dagger+1 1d6+1+special or Pistol, \textbf{THAC0}: 17{[}+2{]}, Movement: 120' (40'), ST: D11 W12 P11 B14 S12, Morale 11, Alignment CE, XP 300.

\item
  Level 3 (2 Slots): Fear, Hold Person, Vampiric Touch, Animate Dead, Temporary,
\item
  Level 4 (1 Slot): Rotting Touch, Dispel Magic, Command Undead
\end{itemize}

\emph{Equipment}: 2 pistols (2 cursed bullets, if hit, target needs to save vs.~Magic or endure a --2 saving throw penalty, a --4 attack roll penalty, or reduce an ability score by 50\%), the \emph{Lifedrinking Dagger of Heremachus} (+1 to attack and damage, on a hit, target has to save vs.~Poison or lose an additional 1d6 HP that transfer to the wielder, wielding this dagger is a profoundly evil act), \emph{Garoli's Flesh Mask} (a mask made from human flesh, lets the wearer assume the looks of another person. Use: once per day, lasts until the next sunrise. Costs 1d6 HP to activate.), \textbf{Bone Idol} (permanent effect of the \emph{Carrion Stench} spell, slowly raises and attracts up to 33 undead in a 24 mile radius. Brandishing the \textbf{Bone Idol}, the owner can command the undead. For the purposes of turning undead in the presence of the \textbf{Bone Idol}, treat the cleric as one level lower.)

Niers is a coward and fights as one. He will hide behind his undead or allied bandits. He delights in others pain and might get too close to someone injured to observe their suffering. If injured, he becomes aggravated and lashes out. If severely injured, he will use Invisibility and run.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{graphics/klaus_waldrach} \end{center}

\subsection{Lise Mueller}\label{lise-mueller}

Daughter of a wine merchant of Metz. Vanished from the town. In truth, she is a witch in league with the devil. Sent to Christman to conceive a child with him. Unsuccessful so far (Christmas has no interest and is too drunk most of the time). Open to an alliance against Christman.

They are aware of each other and rivals, but will not lightly betray the others. They all loath clerics and the Witch Hunter \textbf{Wilhelm von Hagen}.

The \textbf{Black Hag Esmeralda Fettnagel} dwells in \textbf{Hex 0200}. She appears as a woman in her 40s, living in the woods by herself and might be easily mistaken for a witch. She is the one who cursed Peter Stumpp. She is aware of the other witches in the region and is willing to trade information about them for a favor. She is also willing to lift the curse on Peter Stumpp for the right price.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The Graveyard and Crypts, \textbf{Hex 0306}}{The Graveyard and Crypts, Hex 0306}}\label{the-graveyard-and-crypts-hex-0306}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/the-spiral-crypts-patreon} \end{center}

The Graveyard. An old section of tombs, full of treasure and undead. The graveyard has problems with opened tombs and missing bodies, main grave digger (\textbf{Albrecht Stiefel}) is incompetent at dealing with this (old, drunk as a skunk, looks like an old leather shoe). He believes the dead are walking at night. Despite the Bürgermeister having commanded him to keep an eye out, he locks himself into his shed and gets drunk every night. The \textbf{Gravenstein} family offers a reward (2,500 gp) for returning a lost family heirloom (found in Peter Niers tower). The assistant grave digger (\textbf{Hensel Weggeman}, 18 years old, red hair, scar across the cheek) has a deal with Peter Niers to give him access to tombs and bodies.

Above ground: 6 graves that have been dug up in the last month:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  4 graves that have been dug up with tools. People from all walks of life, some recently deceased, some very old bones.
\item
  2 graves dug up by hand/claw. All very recently deceased. The ghouls dig temporary tunnels to the surface, and collapse them after securing a meal. PCs can find evidence of three spots with very loose earth.
\end{itemize}

Crypts below ground: \textbf{Albrecht Stiefel} recently saw two broken grave niches in the crypts. Access to barred via an iron grate. Only he and certain families in town have keys (Gravenstein, von Eberhart, Reims, Hutmeister)

If \textbf{Hensel Weggeman} is questioned, he will be evasive but will buckle under pressure. He will confess a group of men have paid him to give access to the graveyard and crypts. He hands him the key and hides in the gravediggers hut when Albrecht is sleeping off his drunken stupor. They leave a chalk mark in town when they plan to come. They have a wagon, typically three of them show up.

\textbf{The Crypts}
A group of undead have begun to roam the crypts and use it as their lair. Niers' men wear special amulets that identify them as allies. Monsters in the crypt: 8 Ghouls and 1 Ghast (nest in the secret ghoul tunnel); 2 Carcass Crawlers (one has a hidden hole on the ceiling in the first room with a big column, the other lairs at the end of the Northern spiral).

Random Encounters, check every turn

\endlastfoot
1-2 & 3 Ghouls \\
3-5 & 1 Ghast and 2 Ghouls \\
6 & 1 Carcass Crawler \\
\end{longtable}

Any monsters that are part of random encounters should be struck from the overall roster. A loud fight attracts any remaining ghouls.

Crypt Entrance: Dusty floor, but visible tracks of multiple people moving through here, scuff marks on the ground. Christian wall carvings.

Sideroom at the Entrance: Locked, tools and supplies for grave digging and the maintenance of grave niches.

Second side room to the South: Locked, contains blessed candles (when lit, undead need to pass a Saving throw vs Spells to approach, but fast movement is impossible), 8 vials of holy water.

Random small niche or coffin: roll 1D10: 1 broken open and empty, 2-5 sealed no valuables, 6-8 sealed filled with 2D20 gp worth of treasure, 9-10 sealed filled with 3D20+20 worth of treasure.

Random larger niche: roll 1D10: 1-2 broken open and empty, 3-4 sealed no valuables, 5-8 sealed filled with 200 gp + 3D20 gp worth of treasure, 9-10 sealed filled with 400 gp + 4D20 gp worth of treasure.

Ghoul Tunnel: Hidden, found like a secret door.

Gravenstein family niche: End of Western spiral. Broken open, corpse stolen.

Grave niche with Secret door: hidden compartment filled with a scroll case (1 level 1 cleric spells, 1 level 2 cleric spells, 1 level 3 cleric spell), second scroll case (cursed scroll, but looks like arcane script), protected by an old poison needle trap, triggered when the secret level is pulled (3:6 chance of working, Save vs Poison, take 2d6 damage each turn for 1d6 turns).

Most Northern grave: grave of Ritter Ulrich von Eberhart, companion and protector of St.~Jakobus. His grave is undisturbed. Two angel statues flank the grave and one tablet with an inscription: ``Here lies Sir Ulrich von Eberhart, protector of the weak, friend of the poor, and loyal defender of St.~Jakobus.'' Several stone reliefs depict the story of Ulrich von Eberhard: 1st relief shows him traveling next to the Saint. 2nd relief depicts the Battle of Erichfeld, where the Saint was attacked by the Fratzenteufel and died.

\section{What is Going On in Metz?}\label{what-is-going-on-in-metz}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Lise Mueller}, daughter of a respected goldsmith has vanished. The town thinks Christman took her. Regular citizens are calling for more action against the bandits. Her father, Markward Mueller, is offering an old golden torque as a reward (works like a \textbf{Ring of Protection}). He is convinced Christman took her. In reality, he only knows that Lise went for a walk along the river 2 weeks ago and never returned. If anyone asks to see her private chambers, he will be reluctant but will allow it with a strong argument. Her room has a secret compartment under the floor boards (1:6 chance). Her diary can be found there. It details how a man wreathed in shadows has been visiting her dreams and been instructing her in the ``Old Craft''. In exchange, he asked her a favor.
\item
  The \emph{Bürgermeister} of Metz, \textbf{Sigmund Hofstatter}, is keen to address the bandit problem in the region of Metz. He has big plans for more trade and sees the long-term fortune of Metz in jeopardy. He is willing to pursue a more militant strategy. He has issued a 20k gp reward for the capture of Christman, dead or alive. Furthermore, he is offering 1k gp for other bandit leaders. 10gp for a regular bandit.
\item
  A faction on the \emph{Stadtrat}, the wine and cloth merchants, have a secret agreement with Christman. They pay him handsomely to engage in his banditry away from Metz. They fear the Bürgermeister's new approach is threatening their agreement and secretly oppose him. They are scheming to have the mayor disgraced. They are considering fomenting religious strife in town with the help of the Witch Hunters. The resulting conflict might distract the mayor or even offer an opportunity to remove him.
\item
  Corpses have been vanishing from the graveyard (\textbf{Peter Niers} is using the assistant grave digger to procure fresh corpses.). Some wealthy citizens are becoming concerned and are offering a 2,000 gp reward to stop whoever is looting the graves and return a missing family heirloom (to be found in \textbf{Peter Niers'} tower).
\item
  City of Metz is in a feud with \textbf{Goetz von Berlichingen}, famous robber knight. There is a reward of 5,000 gp, financed by the guilds, for whoever can bring an end to the feud.
\item
  \textbf{Bartholomäus Bock}, local scholar and investor in the printing press, has not been seen for a few days. \textbf{Bartholomäus Bock} is a member of the Kristallbund and has a secret laboratory under his office. He recently died down there trying to create artificial life. The Kristallbund is a Secret Society, focused on the Enlightenment, magical power, and is fervently anti-religious (This is the Age of Man, not God!).

\chapter{Peter Niers' Tower}\label{tower}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/guimonds-tower-and-druid-lich-lair-patreon annotated} \end{center}

\section{Background}\label{background}

Peter Niers stumbled on this old wizard's tower two years ago and has made it his lair. He has been scheming from the tower to wrestle control of the different bandit groups from Christman and terrorize the wider region.

He is slowly building his retinue of undead by attracting them from the local area and paying the grave digger of Metz to deliver him 4 more bodies every week.

When Peter Niers has amassed 33 undead and struck a deal with the \textbf{Greencloak Pikes}, he will attack Christman's Lair to claim the \textbf{The Rites of the Pale Wedding}.

\section{The Tower}\label{the-tower}

No birds or insects within 50ft of the tower. Just sticky air and an oppressive silence.

\textbf{Area 1}
Wooden shed built adjacent to the tower. Main entrance. Simple wooden door (locked). Inside the shed, bits and pieces of human bodies. A \textbf{Carrion Crawler} hides on a hole under the stone steps. Simple stone steps to the tower entrance.

\textbf{Area 2}
Reinforced wooden door (locked) and covered in arcane symbols (\emph{Alarm} spell). South wall a treasure chest with a poisoned dart (Save vs poison or death). Chest contains alchemical ingredients, 2 level 3 MU spell scrolls, the lost necklace of the Gravenstein family (3500 gp), 650 gp). Two doors on the Western side (unlocked). Both doors are covered in frost. A set of stairs in the North leading up to level 2.

\textbf{Area 3}
Storage room. Peter Niers cast a cold spell on the whole room. Filled with 12 corpses and individual body parts.

\textbf{Area 4}
Secret trapdoor to the basement area--Peter Niers' actual hideout. Covered with dirt and sand. The other sides of the tower have grass growing.

\textbf{Area 5}
Level 2 of the tower. Southwestern wall has collapsed. Spiraling staircase on the Western side. Empty.

\textbf{Area 6}
Western and Eastern Walls have collapsed. 6 \textbf{Skeletons} with spears hold guard. Will push intruders off the tower (30ft drop. Save vs breath or take 2d6 damage.)

\textbf{Area 7}
Top floor of the tower. Arcane summoning circle in the middle. This is were Peter Niers converses with the devil \textbf{Zalfaxx}, which he summoned weeks ago. \textbf{Zalfaxx} told Peter Niers about the \textbf{Bone Idol}.

A \textbf{Bone Golem} stands guard.

\textbf{Zalfaxx} is willing to parlay with intruders and betray Niers, e.g., tell them about his \textbf{Bone Idol} and that the \textbf{Remains of St.~Jakobus} can counteract it.

\textbf{Area 8}
Entrance to the basement. Wet and slippery stairs lead down into a crumbling basement.

\textbf{Area 9}

\textbf{Area 10}
Square room with a large central pillar (tower foundation). Scorch marks on the stones. Northern wall with 5 niches. Each niche has a grave candle. Candles 2, 3, 5 are lit. Extinguishing all candles reveals the secret tunnels on the Eastern side. Lighting all candles triggers a fireball spell.

Two tunnels on the Eastern side that lead deeper underground into a natural cave. Hidden by illusion magic.

\textbf{Area 11}
Central cave with a dark pond, 10ft deep. A \textbf{Gibbering Mouther} nests here and protects Peter Niers' hideout.

\textbf{Area 12}
Peter Niers' camp. A bedroll, candles, rations, his spellbook. He keeps a rotting corpse here to fall asleep next to.

\textbf{Area 13}
Small altar were Peter Niers keeps the \textbf{Bone Idol}. The Idol was empowered through human sacrifice. Implied evidence for the sacrifice of fetuses.

\textbf{Bone Idol}. Permanent effect of the \emph{Carrion Stench} spell. Slowly raises and attracts up to 33 undead in a 24 mile radius. Brandishing the \textbf{Bone Idol}, the owner can command the undead. For the purposes of turning undead in the presence of the \textbf{Bone Idol}, treat the cleric as one level lower.

\textbf{Rites of the Pale Wedding}. A dark ritual to attain lichdom. The ritual requires a body assembled from human flesh, the sacrifice of several human lives, and a ritual incantation under the pale moon, completing a wedding ritual. Upon completion, the caster is turned into a lich. The caster transfers their soul into the body of the dead bride. Completing the wedding vows raises the bride to undeath and turns her into a walking phylactery. Peter Niers believes this is a way to achieve lichdem and creating a wife that will fulfill his every whim.

\textbf{The Truth}. The Ritual is a trap. Completing the ritual does make the caster a lich, but not in the way typically imagined. Transferring a piece of your soul to the undead bride fills her with unlife, giving her a full and independent (malignant) personality, with a deep loathing of the caster. The transfer also renders the caster unable to ever cast spells again. The bride in turns becomes a M-U of the same level as the ritual caster and knows all the caster's spells. The caster gains eternal unlife, but is bound to be a rotting wretch, tied to the bride in eternal servitude. The caste retains their spell slots, which the bride can use at will to power her own spells, as long as the caster is within 30ft of the bride. The caster essentially becomes a spell battery. The Ritual can be easily adapted to switch or change the genders of the caster or bride

\chapter{Christman's Lair}\label{lair}

\section{General Notes}\label{general-notes}

ADD TIMETABLE FOR CHRISTMAN?

This is Christman's secret lair in the Frassberg region. He has lived here for decades and made the cave system his home. There are three ``factions'' active in the dungeon:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Christman Grippertenius}. Spends most of his days drinking himself into a stupor. Will either kill or capture any intruders. Prisoners will be tortured and eventually killed. He treats Lise Mueller as a scullery maid and otherwise ignores her. He is afraid of the ghost of Getrude Kaasman. If he thinks a part of the cave system is currently being haunted by the ghost, he will move as far away as possible.
\item
  \textbf{Lise (Lischen) Mueller}. A satanic witch. She let herself be captured by Christman and is his current ``wife''. Christman is known for haven taken many ``wives'' (i.e., abducted women and kept them in his dungeon against their will) over the years. In his old age, he has done so less frequently and mostly does it out of habit and for having someone around to help him clean. Lise is a cunning witch that has out herself into Christman's hands in order to conceive a child with him. Because Christman has no interest in her (or anyone for that matter) and is mostly drunk, she is scheming to spoil is alcohol supply, cut off future deliveries, and otherwise get him to pay attention to her. She is not beyond considering murdering Christman to get what she needs from his corpse. She has cast Charm on Christman, but his black soul has weakened the effects of the spell. Deep down, Christman fears Lise and tries to find excuses to be away from her.
\item
  The ghost of \textbf{Gertrude Kaasmann}. One of Christman's prior ``wives''. He murdered her and her child 23 years ago. She is a mere echo of a mother's grief and a general menace to any living creature. If she can be made to remember what happened to her, she can become an, albeit temporary, ally against Christman.
\end{itemize}

There are otherwise few creatures about in the dungeon. Christman's lair is a murderhole which he stalks like a predator. Try to play up the atmosphere of discovering serial killer's home (e.g., think Jame Gumb's basement in the movie Silence of the Lambs).

Christman has accumulated a huge amount of treasure over the years. Anyone brave enough to enter the caves and survive, might lay claim to unimaginable riches.

Due to Christman's familiarity with the dungeon, the base chance of Surprise increases from 2-6 to 4-6 for PCs. If Christman retreats from a fight, he has a 2-6 chance of simply vanishing when he runs into another room and PCs lose line of sight. This is not a supernatural ability and if PCs have extraordinary means of keeping track of Christman, this ability is countered.

\textbf{L1}: Main entrance to the cave. Smells of acrid smoke. Graffiti on the wall at the entrance: ``Cristman's Castle''. 6ft further down the tunnel, PCs can see more markings on the wall. The markings are pure gibberish, trying to invoke a foreign alphabet. Christman built a spiked pit trap (8ft deep) filled with lye right next to the markings. Save vs breath (DCC: Reflex save DC 10) or take 1d6 damage from the spikes and 1 point of caustic burn damage for every round in the pit. If the PC took 4 or more points of damage from the spike, they injured one of their extremities and it is more difficult to climb out of the pit.

\textbf{L2}: Secret entrance on ground level, completely covered by poison ivy. Touching the ivy Save vs Poison (DCC: Fort save DC 11) or develop a serious rash that lingers for 1d4 days. Cannot wear armor while afflicted by the rash. Cure Disease (DCC: Lay on Hands for 2 HD) removes.

\textbf{L3}: Secret entrance. On a ledge 20ft up from the ground and hard to see. At the cave entrance, a thin tripwire is connected to a bell to the alarm bells in L4. When bells are rung, 1D6+3 of Christman's dogs appear within 1 turn.

\textbf{L4}: Central intersection. Tripwires with alarm bells. Bells attract 1D6+3 of Christman's dogs appear within 1 turn.

\textbf{L5}: Room with a barricade that faces and blocks access to L4. An additiona piece of barricade can be moved quickly to block the northern exit. Two loaded crossbows lean against the wall. They have poisoned arrow tips. If hurt, save vs Poison (DCC: Fort save DC 12) or spend 1d3 rounds wretching and unable to act.

\textbf{L6}: Kennel room. Smells like dog feces and urine. Barks can be heard when approaching. 6 dog kennels total, only one is closed. Inside, one injured but aggressive dog (sprained leg). One large kennel is up on the elevated rock ledge. Old carpets and furs on the ground. They cover a hidden pressure plate. If someone steps on it, spring-loaded wooden barriers block the two exits and the door to the kennel on the elevated rock ledge opens.Inside this cage is a hungry \textbf{Bear}, trained by Christman to prefer human flesh.

\textbf{L7}: The smell of dog urine and feces. The room is filled with additional dog kennels. Barrels full of dog food. There are at least 1d6+2 dogs resting in this room.

\textbf{L8}: Storage room. Filled with sacks of flour, barrels of fish, cheeses, smoked meats. Cage with iron bars and a heavy lock (DCC Pick locks DC 7). Inside are racks of wine (60 bottles of wine, each worth 20 sp). At the Northwestern side of the room, a wall carpet hides a secret vertical, winding tunnel with a rope that leads to Level 2 (\textbf{L24}).

\textbf{L9}: Fletchery. Chaotic workshop, tools strewn about, pieces of wood, piles of feathers. Whoever is working here has high skill, but is extremely untidy and disorganized. A total of 37 arrows can be recovered from this room. Northern side has a tunnel exit that leads to Level 2 (\textbf{L14}).

\textbf{L10}: From the ceiling hang long wires with thin glass bulbs attached. The lenght of the wires varies from 1 ft off the floor to 5ft off the floor. The bulbs do not touch each other and there is at most 1 ft room between two bulbs. There are burns marks all over the floor and walls. The glass bulbs are filled with a highly-reactive alchemical substance that is activated when moved about too much. If someone carelessly walks through the room and a bulb starts swinging, it triggers a reaction and the bulb explodes in a fiery explosion, sending glass shards everywhere. This triggers all other bulbs to explode. Carefully traversing the room requires a Save vs.~Breath (DCC Reflex save DC 12) (or some other approach). Failure triggers the trap and causes 6d6 explosion damage to anyone in the room and 2d4 continued alchemical burn damage for 1d4+2 rounds (the goey substance does not come off easily).

\textbf{L11}: A terrible smell of decay, feces, and urine. A room used for skinning and tanning room. Several skinned animal carcasses hang from the ceiling (some have human bite marks). One skinned human carcass among the animals. A trough for tanning.

Hanging like wind chimes from the ceiling, dried, stretched out and flayed baby corpses.

\textbf{L25}: Walls, floor, and ceiling are covered with rough charcoal sketches of people, faces, and murder scenes. Christman has drawn all his murders here and comes to the room to relive the experience, while pleasuring himself. The room is filled with the spiritual anguish of Christman's victims.
